# Data Enineer

### Skills: Python, SQL, Tableau, Excel, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Data Cleaning

### [PROJECT 1: Data Warehousing](https://github.com/nk8410j/nasrakhalif.github.io)
*  Extracted data by establishing an ODBC connection and exporting it to Oracle
*  Created new tables, imported data into the tables, and meticulously cleansed the data.
*  Designed and created a data mart, aligning it with specific business requirements.
*  Ran queries with joins to demonstrate the operational status of the data warehouse.

### [PROJECT 2:Advanced Database](https://github.com/nk8410j/nasrakhalif.github.io)
*  Created data files, including users, temp, undo, system, and sysaux, establishing the foundational structure for database operations
* Implemented security requirements using SQL commands.
* Established a tablespace to allocate space within the database for storing schema objects, optimizing data organization and access.
*  Created users and profiles, defining access and privileges within the database.
*  Facilitated data migration of data betweeen systems, including back up and recovery procedures.

### [PROJECT 3: Business Intelligence and Data mining](https://github.com/nk8410j/nasrakhalif.github.io)
*  In this project the aim was to clean and anaylse a large set of AIRBNB dataset to derive accurate insights and create a tool for price prediction. 
*  Developed an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram integrated with Tableau, providing a visual representation of the data.
*  Conducted Data cleaning using pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data presentation.
*  Machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR), Polynomial Regression and Linear Regression used to predict accurate pricing based on selected features.
*  Found that the Random Forest Regression model produced more accurate predictions. 
*  Created a Tableau dashboard to display a summarized overview of the data, providing an accessible and visually engaging representation of key insights.

### [PROJECT 4: Cloud and Virtualisation](https://github.com/nk8410j/nasrakhalif.github.io)
*  Computed a temperature distribution for a rectangular 2D problem with boundary conditions set at top 30°C,      bottom 60°C, left 110°C and right 140°C with a range of problem sizes.
*  Modified the applications to produce a basic parallel version of the codes using OpenMP.
*  Conducted performance tests on CMS-Grid machines with the OpenMP implementation.
*  Improved the parallel performance using different OpenMP directives and clauses.

### [PROJECT 5: Big Data: Timeseries Stock Price Forecasting](https://github.com/nk8410j/nasrakhalif.github.io)

* Analyzed stock prices and aimed to create an accurate predictive model for future stock trends.
Utilized Apache Spark to transform a dataset that included tweets and processed stock prices in Jupyter notebook.
*  Evaluated predictive models including ARIMA, SVR, and LSTM.
*  Concluded that the LSTM model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting stock prices.
